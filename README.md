# CvilleClimbs
This is the repository for all code related to CS 4750 project. 
This project seeks to build a climbing database from scratch, populate it and create a web application to 
manipulate, visualize and retrieve data. The purpose of this database is to allow its users to explore 
user-generated information about outdoor climbing routes that have been established around Charlottesville, VA. 

Juptyer Notebook was used to generate the SQL code included in the .txt files. 
The .txt files can be cut and paste into any MySQL server to create a database that has already been populated and contained definitions about the relationships between the data.
